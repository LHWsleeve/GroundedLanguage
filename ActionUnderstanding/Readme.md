This directory contains simple Feed-Forward and Recurrent Neural Network architectures for action taking in Blocks World.
There are three paradigms presented here:

  1. STRP -- Source, Target, Relative Position
  2. STxyz -- Source, Target, (x,y,z)
  3. Sxyz -- Source, (x,y,z)

Evaluation:

  |  Model   | Source | Target | RP | Mean Err | Median Err |
  |  ------- | ------ | ------ | -- | -------- | ---------- |
  |  FF-STRP |        |        |    |          |            |
  | RNN-STRP |        |        |    |          |            |
  | FF-STxyz |        |        |    |          |            |
  | RNN-STxyz|        |        |    |          |            |
  |  FF-Sxyz |        |        |    |          |            |
  | RNN-Sxyz |        |        |    |          |            |
